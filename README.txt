Call the makefile with make.
Then use ./findLCS to run the program.
Then input how many pairs of strings will be input, e.g. "3".
The input the pairs of strings side by side one pair at a time.
Example input is in small.txt, executed by ./findLCS < small.txt

And optional flag is -all before the pairs/text file with pairs is input. This will cause all longest subsequences to be printed. An example is ./findLCS -all < small.txt.
